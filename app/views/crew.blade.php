            <p> At Frak.tv we belive that appulactions should run the way YOU want them too! deliver content YOU want to see and have their development shaped by YOU the user (do ya see a theme starting here?)</p>
              <p>We create apps that we use ourselves, after being disappointed over and over again by app manufactures churning out meat grinder style products we took our queue from one of the great poets of our time.<br />

			<p>Myself(the ringleader) and my eye patched, pirate band of misfits are fed up with the status quo of streaming apps, and we intend on doing something about it !  I’ve handed control of the Frak.tv air waves over to my chief Instigator for a full revamp.  Soon the rebranded, reimagined and fully Fraked over “Stay Tuned” app will be chugging back web requests like the reigning champion of a drinking contest. </p>
			
            <h2>The Chief Instigator</h2><p>The chief Instigator of Frak.tv is a fully qualifyed mainac,  he heads up our S&D department (search & destroy).  He’s charged with the kidnapping and murder of the internet development rule book and I doubt the authorities will ever take him alive.  During his reign of terror here at Frak.tv he intends on delevering up some internet jewles. Frag & Stay Tuned are just the begining of internet smut he intends to produce.  With his ideals of dev/deliver and Hyper|Prototyping he’s a perfet match for the type of development studio Frak.tv is to become.  We are excited to have him swerve our steering committees all over the internet roadmap like a drunken teenager,  His job at Frak.tv is to try to go more than one day without strangeling someone to death with their own code. I’m not sure he’s up to it, so we put him in charge instead. Good Luck.
</p> 


			<h2>The Conscience</h2><p>Every offender at here Frak.tv needs a conscience, and since no one here has their own we decided to hire in for the position.  Her job will be to spend her days collecting data on our products and filling our apps with the kick ass content you already love from Frak.tv. Shes got her work cut out for her, as the ringleader and the instigator are pretty crafty when it comes to mayhem, there always coming up with new ways to challenge the world to a proverbial “fight in the parking lot”.  Much as you’d think, The Conscience is appalled by these actions, but she has to put up with it. She’s married to the ringleader!.  Good Luck</p> 
			
            
            <h2>The Ringleader</h2><p>I guess that brings you to me.  As the ringleader for this mob ruffians its my job to keep apps coming.  I dig up the treasure that funds The Instigator’s next mad science experiment. Sometimes you need to break a few knee caps to get software funded but, I’m not that hard to get along with as long as I get my way.  With a development history that spans over 20 years, I fully intend on letting The Instigator take over your air waves, right after I courise him to take out our advisory board. I found out that radical ideas and free through are not welcome in a boardroom.  Those ideals lead to hurt feelings and arguments in the office with narrow minded bosses.  You windmill one coffee cup at a threatening co-worker and *POOF* your branded an outcast.  So The Instigator and I are gonna turn this industry upside-down, whether you like it, or not!
